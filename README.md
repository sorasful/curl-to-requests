# curl-to-requests-
A CLI tool which converts a curl command to a Python requests command.

### Still in development !

Usage `curl_to_requests.py curl 'http://example.com' -d {'user':}`

which will output a string corresponding to a the Python code for the requests. Just import requests and copy/paste it.  


Enjoy
